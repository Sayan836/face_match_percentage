This project is basically based on comparing two faces. I used the face_recognition, OpenCV and numpy modules here to do the work. the program basically takes two images of two different faces and shows  a percentage of how much similar the 2 faces are.

NOTE:
     If you put of 2 different images of same person then the output will not give 100% matched result nut it will give a certain percent above 60 which means it is perfectly matched.
     The percentage shown (when 2 differnet faces are given) will always be less than 50% which means the computer will understand the 2 faces are of different people.
